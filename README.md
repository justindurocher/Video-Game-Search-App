# Video Game Search with Related News

As gamers, we wanted to be able to search for video games and fetch related news so that we can stay updated on the most recent changes and patches to our favorite games.

## Description

This app can be used to search the [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) API for video games, and searches the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) for related information via the title of the game. The live version of this app is hosted by GitHub Pages at [justindurocher.github.io/Video-Game-Search-App](https://justindurocher.github.io/Video-Game-Search-App/).

## Installation

This repo consists of front end web files. To run this app locally after cloning the repo, open index.html in your browser of choice. Please keep in mind that while the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) doesn't require an API key, the News API does. The key used here is a free key that is intended for demonstration purposes. If this key stops working, make a an account at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) to get a free key and update the related fields in the assets/js/script.js file.
